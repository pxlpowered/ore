# Reporting an Issue, Requesting a Feature

When submitting an issue through GitHub Issues, please remember that we are volunteers, and as volunteers, we have
limited time to be able to help. We would love to spend as much time fixing your issues and implementing features
as possible. To that end, please keep the following in mind when reporting bugs and requesting features:

* Make the title of the report clear. "It's broken" does not help us much, "Request always returns an error" is more helpful and lets us see what is wrong just by looking at the list.

* When reporting a bug:
    * Describe how you reproduce the bug step by step
    * Explain what you expect to happen
    * Explain what actually happens
    * Include backtraces (using RUST_BACKTRACE=1)

* When describing a feature:
    * Tell us what you'd like to see
    * Tell us why you want it, and what the use case is
    * Give us an idea on how it should work

* If we need more information about a bug or a feature, we'll ask for clarification! We want to get the system right.

For more information about writing a bug report in general, have a look at [this page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html),
particularly the summary at the bottom.
